```python
import csv
import pickle

with open('./../dataset/isolet/isolet.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    isolet = pickle.load(f)
trainData, trainLabels, testData, testLabels = isolet

with open('train.csv', "w", newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for val in trainData:
        writer.writerow(val)

with open('test.csv', "w", newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for val in testData:
        writer.writerow(val)

with open('train_labels.csv', "w", newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for val in trainLabels:
        writer.writerow([val])

with open('test_labels.csv', "w", newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for val in testLabels:
        writer.writerow([val])
